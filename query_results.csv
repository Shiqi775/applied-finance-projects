MAR,What are the main risk factors of this company?,2015,"The main risk factors of this company include intense industry competition, economic uncertainty, operational risks, development and financing risks, and risks associated with partnerships and residential property development.","14 Table of Contents Item 1A.
Risk Factors.
Forward-Looking Statements We make forward-looking statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this report based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to us.
Forward-looking statements include information about our possible or assumed future results of operations, which follow under the headings “Business and Overview,” “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and other statements throughout this report preceded by, followed by or that include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates” or similar expressions.
Any number of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those we express in our forward-looking statements, including the risks and uncertainties we describe below and other factors we describe from time to time in our periodic filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
We therefore caution you not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statement.
The forward-looking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.
Risks and Uncertainties We are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on us or on our financial condition.
You should understand that these risks could cause results to differ materially from those we express in forward-looking statements contained in this report or in other Company communications.
Because there is no way to determine in advance whether, or to what extent, any present uncertainty will ultimately impact our business, you should give equal weight to each of the following: Our industry is highly competitive, which may impact our ability to compete successfully with other hotel properties for customers.
We operate in markets that contain many competitors.
Each of our hotel brands competes with major hotel chains in national and international venues and with independent companies in regional markets.
Our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain business and leisure travelers depends on our success in distinguishing the quality, value, and efficiency of our lodging products and services, including our loyalty programs and consumer-facing technology platforms and services, from those offered by others.
If we cannot compete successfully in these areas, our operating margins could contract, our market share could decrease, and our earnings could decline.
Further, new lodging supply in individual markets could have a negative impact on the hotel industry and hamper our ability to increase room rates or occupancy in those markets.
Economic uncertainty could continue to impact our financial results and growth.
Weak economic conditions in Europe and other parts of the world, the strength or continuation of recovery in countries that have experienced improved economic conditions, changes in oil prices and currency values, potential disruptions in the U.S. economy as a result of governmental action or inaction on the federal deficit, budget, and related issues, including for example the 2013 U.S. federal government shutdown, political instability in some areas, and the uncertainty over how long any of these conditions will continue, could continue to have a negative impact on the lodging industry.
U.S. government travel is also a significant part of our business, and this aspect of our business may continue to suffer due to U.S. federal spending cuts and any further limitations that may result from congressional action or inaction.
As a result of such current economic conditions and uncertainty, we continue to experience weakened demand for our hotel rooms in some markets.
Recent improvements in demand trends in other markets may not continue, and our future financial results and growth could be further harmed or constrained if the recovery stalls or conditions worsen.
Operational Risks Premature termination of our management or franchise agreements could hurt our financial performance.
Our hotel management and franchise agreements may be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances, such as the bankruptcy of a hotel owner or franchisee, or a failure under some agreements to meet specified financial or performance criteria that are subject to the risks described in this section, which we fail or elect not to cure.
In addition, some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of third-party hotel properties, including us (or have interpreted hotel management agreements as “personal services contracts”).
This means, among other things, that property owners may assert the right to terminate management agreements even where the agreements provide otherwise, and some courts have upheld such assertions about our management agreements and may do so in the future.
If such terminations occur, we may need to enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related claims, which may cause us to incur significant legal fees and expenses.
Any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected future value of the fees and other amounts we would have otherwise collected under the management agreement.
A significant loss of agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our financial performance or our ability to grow our business. 15 Table of Contents Our lodging operations are subject to global, regional, and national conditions.

As a result, we could lose some or all of any capital that we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, and we could remain obligated for guarantees, debt, or other financial obligations for the property. 17 Table of Contents Development and Financing Risks While w e are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties, our hotel owners depend on capital to buy, develop, and improve hotels, and our hotel owners may be unable to access capital when necessary.
In order to fund new hotel investments, as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels, both we and current and potential hotel owners must periodically spend money.
The availability of funds for new investments and improvement of existing hotels by our current and potential hotel owners depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors, over which we can exert little control.
The difficulty of obtaining financing on attractive terms may be constrained by the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments.
In addition, owners of existing hotels that we franchise or manage may have difficulty meeting required debt service payments or refinancing loans at maturity.
Our growth strategy depends upon third-party owners/operators, and future arrangements with these third parties may be less favorable.
Our growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various arrangements with property owners.
The terms of our management agreements, franchise agreements, and leases for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors, among other things.
We cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations, renew agreements, or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today.
Our ability to grow our management and franchise systems is subject to the range of risks associated with real estate investments.
Our ability to sustain continued growth through management or franchise agreements for new hotels and the conversion of existing facilities to managed or franchised Marriott brands is affected, and may potentially be limited, by a variety of factors influencing real estate development generally.
These include site availability, financing, planning, zoning and other local approvals, and other limitations that may be imposed by market and submarket factors, such as projected room occupancy, changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply, territorial restrictions in our management and franchise agreements, costs of construction, and anticipated room rate structure.
Our development activities expose us to project cost, completion, and resale risks.
We develop new hotel and residential properties, both directly and through partnerships, joint ventures, and other business structures with third parties.
As demonstrated by the impairment charges that we recorded in the 2014 first half in connection with our development and construction of three EDITION hotels, our ongoing involvement in the development of properties presents a number of risks, including that (1) continued weakness in the capital markets may limit our ability, or that of third parties with whom we do business, to raise capital for completion of projects that have commenced or for development of future properties; (2) properties that we develop could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for hotel and residential properties, market absorption or oversupply, with the result that we may not be able to sell such properties for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we anticipate, potentially requiring additional changes in our pricing strategy that could result in further charges; (3) construction delays, cost overruns, lender financial defaults, or so called “Acts of God” such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, or fires may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations; and (4) we may be unable to recover development costs we incur for any projects that we do not pursue to completion.
Development activities that involve our co-investment with third parties may result in disputes that could increase project costs, impair project operations, or increase project completion risks.
Partnerships, joint ventures, and other business structures involving our co-investment with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create added risks, including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations, or could have or develop business interests, policies, or objectives that are inconsistent with ours.
Although we actively seek to minimize such risks before investing in partnerships, joint ventures, or similar structures, actions by another investor may present additional risks of project delay, increased project costs, or operational difficulties following project completion.
Such disputes may also be more likely in difficult business environments.
Risks associated with development and sale of residential properties associated with our lodging properties or brands may reduce our profits.
In certain hotel and timeshare projects we participate, directly or through noncontrolling interests and/or licensing agreements, in the development and sale of residential properties associated with our brands, including residences and condominiums under our The Ritz-Carlton, EDITION, JW Marriott, Autograph Collection, and Marriott brand names and trademarks."
SBUX,What are the main products of this company?,2017,"The main products of this company are coffee beverages, tea, ready-to-drink beverages, food products such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches, and lunch items, and paper and plastic products like cups and cutlery.","We believe, based on relationships established with our dairy suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote.
Products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks ® stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts.
Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional and local sources.
Our food program continues to develop, and we expect the amount of food products purchased to impact our operations.
We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations.
We believe, based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items is remote. 7 Table of Contents Competition Our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee shops offering premium and artisanal products and experiences.
In almost all markets in which we do business, there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business.
We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality, service and convenience, as well as price.
We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the U.S. quick-service restaurant sector and the U.S. ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to well-established companies in many international markets.
We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.
Our coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores and U.S. foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market.
Trademarks, Copyrights, Patents and Domain Names Starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world.
Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve, Tazo, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Teavana, Frappuccino, Starbucks VIA and La Boulange are of material importance.
The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country.
However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.
We own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics and training materials.
We also hold patents on certain products, systems and designs.
In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including “Starbucks.com,” “Starbucks.net,” “Tazo.com,” “Seattlesbest.com” and “Teavana.com.” Seasonality and Quarterly Results Our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income.
Additionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year.
However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the Card, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced.
As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.
Employees Starbucks employed approximately 277,000 people worldwide as of October 1, 2017 .
In the U.S., Starbucks employed approximately 185,000 people, with approximately 175,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in support facilities, store development, and roasting, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations.
Approximately 92,000 employees were employed outside of the U.S., with approximately 89,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in regional support operations.
The number of Starbucks employees represented by unions is not significant.
We believe our current relations with our employees are good.

Mr.
Schultz has served as chairman of the board of directors since Starbucks inception in 1985, and in January 2008, he reassumed the role of president and chief executive officer.

Additionally, we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers.
If customers become ill from food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination, mislabeling or other food or beverage-safety issues, we could be forced to temporarily close some stores and/or supply chain facilities, as well as recall products.
In addition, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could, by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general, adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis.
A decrease in customer traffic as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, product recalls or food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, could materially harm our business and results of operations.
Some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects.
Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products.
While we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories, 11 Table of Contents an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, potential imposition of additional taxes on certain types of beverages, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations. • The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of Starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.
Our information technology systems, such as those we use for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, including online and mobile payment systems and rewards programs, and for administrative functions, including human resources, payroll, accounting and internal and external communications, as well as the information technology systems of our third party business partners and service providers, can contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees.
Our information technology systems also contain Starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans, product development initiatives and designs.
Similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we have experienced frequent attempts to compromise our information technology systems.
To the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party’s information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft, use or destruction of customers' or employees' data or that of the Company stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans.
Such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability.
For example, the European Union adopted a new regulation that becomes effective in May 2018, called the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves.
Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue.
Our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly respond to these incidents.
Such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability.
Significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached.
These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems."

Cash Flow The following table summarizes our cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 326,401 $ 247,906 $ 248,521 Net cash used in investing activities $ (185,340 ) $ (130,466 ) $ (110,831 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (102,809 ) $ (107,376 ) $ (212,591 ) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $326.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $247.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was principally due to an increase in cash receipts of $141.5 million, a decrease in excess tax benefit from exercised stock options of $6.1 million, a decrease in payments of acquisition related liabilities of $1.9 million, and a decrease in salary and employee related payments of $10.2 million due to an additional pay-cycle that occurred in 2008.
Our payroll is processed on a bi-weekly basis thereby requiring an additional pay-cycle once every ten years.
This increase in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in operating expense related payments of $63.6 million, an increase in tax payments of $12.1 million and an increase in interest payments of $5.2 million.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $247.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $248.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.
The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was principally due to an additional pay-cycle of $10.2 million that occurred in 2008.
In addition, we had a $5.0 million minimum required funding to our pension plan and one-time payments associated with the preparation for our initial public offering.
This decrease was mitigated by growth in net income of $7.9 million and decreased payments associated with acquisition related liabilities of $11.5 million.
Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $185.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $130.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
The increase in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to increased cash paid for acquisitions, including escrow funding, of $48.5 million and an increase in purchase of fixed assets of $8.0 million.
Net cash used in investing activities was $130.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $110.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.
The increase in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to the payment of acquisition related liabilities of $98.1 million, resulting from achievement of post-acquisition performance targets, and the purchase of cost-method investments of $5.8 million.
These increases are partially offset by decreases in purchases of available-for-sale securities of approximately $43.7 million, cash paid for acquisitions of $31.7 million and cash inflows related to the termination of the stockholder loan program of $3.9 million.
Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $102.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $107.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to a decrease in the repurchases of stock of $345.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term and short-term debt of $312.5 million, a decrease in proceeds from stock options exercised of $22.6 million and a decrease in excess tax benefit from stock options exercised of $6.1 million."
VRSK,What are the primary costs affecting the company's profitability?,2010,"The primary costs affecting the company's profitability are Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, Cost of Revenues, Depreciation and Amortization, and Interest Expense.","There was also an increase in office maintenance fees of $0.3 million.
The increase was partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses of $3.8 million, which include decreases in travel and auto related costs, and a decrease in data and consultant costs of $1.4 million.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses for our Risk Assessment segment were $82.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $81.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $0.7 million or 0.9%.
Included within the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is the accelerated ESOP allocation, which resulted in a non-recurring non-cash charge of $7.5 million.
Excluding this accelerated ESOP charge, our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $6.8 million or 8.2%.
The decrease was primarily due to lower legal costs of $4.1 million primarily associated with the preparation for our initial public offering in 2008, an insurance cost recovery of $1.7 million and other general expenses of $1.4 million.
These decreases was partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefit costs of $0.4 million, which include increased pension costs of $2.4 million offset by a decrease in salaries and other employee benefits.
EBITDA Margin The EBITDA margin for our Risk Assessment segment was 40.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 44.2% for the year ended December 31, 2008.
Included in the calculation of our EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2009, are non-recurring, non-cash costs of $32.9 million associated with the accelerated ESOP allocation prior to our initial public offering, representing a 6.3% negative impact in EBITDA margin, and increased pension costs of $15.1 million, representing a 2.8% negative impact on our EBITDA margin.
Also included in the calculation of our EBITDA margin are costs of $4.1 and $5.8 million associated with the preparation for our initial public offering for the year ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, representing a 0.8% and 1.1% negative impact, respectively, in EBITDA margin for each period. 32 Table of Contents Decision Analytics Results of Operations Revenues Revenues for our Decision Analytics segment were $503.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $389.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $113.9 million or 29.3%.
In 2008 and 2009, we acquired two companies and three companies, respectively.
These acquisitions accounted for $1.3 million and $34.5 million of additional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively.
The increase in revenue relating to the acquisitions was $33.2 million, of which $33.1 million relates to the loss prediction category and $0.1 million relates to the fraud and detection solutions category.
Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, revenues increased $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
Our fraud and detection solutions revenue increased $59.1 million primarily in our fraud detection and forensic audit services for the home mortgage and mortgage insurance industries as well as in response to the increased scrutiny and refinancing within the mortgage industry.
Increased revenue in our loss prediction solutions primarily resulted from our acquisitions and increased penetration of our existing customers.
Our loss quantification revenues increased as a result of new customer contracts and volume increases associated with natural disasters experienced in the United States.
Our revenue by category for the periods presented is set forth below: Year Ended December 31, Percentage 2009 2008 Change (In thousands) Fraud identification and detection solutions $ 273,103 $ 213,994 27.6 % Loss prediction solutions 137,328 95,128 44.4 % Loss quantification solutions 92,697 80,037 15.8 % Total Decision Analytics $ 503,128 $ 389,159 29.3 % Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues for our Decision Analytics segment was $260.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $187.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $73.8 million or 39.5%.
The increase was primarily due to the accelerated ESOP allocation, which resulted in a non-cash non-recurring charge of $19.0 million prior to our initial public offering and costs related to the newly acquired companies of $17.7 million.

Segment operating expenses consist of direct and indirect costs principally related to personnel, facilities, software license fees, consulting, travel, and third-party information services.
Indirect costs are generally allocated to the segments using fixed rates established by management based upon estimated expense contribution levels and other assumptions that management considers reasonable.
The Company does not allocate investment income, realized losses, interest income, interest expense or income tax expense, since these items are not considered in evaluating the segments overall operating performance.
The CODM does not evaluate the financial performance of each segment based on assets.
On a geographic basis, no individual country outside of the United States accounted for 1% or more of the Companys consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 or 2008.
No individual country outside of the United States accounted for 1% or more of total consolidated long-term assets as of December 31, 2009 or 2008.

• our ability to create cost efficiencies through changes in our operational processes and to further digitize our processes and interfaces with our clients, any failure of which, in whole or in part, may among other things, reduce our competitive position, diminish the cost-effectiveness of our systems and processes or provide an insufficient return on our associated investment; • our ability to promote a strong culture of risk management, operating controls, compliance oversight, ethical behavior and governance that meets our expectations and those of our clients and our regulators, and the financial, regulatory, reputation and other consequences of our failure to meet such expectations; • the impact on our compliance and controls enhancement programs associated with the appointment of a monitor under the deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ and compliance consultant appointed under a settlement with the SEC, including the potential for such monitor and compliance consultant to require changes to our programs or to identify other issues that require substantial expenditures, changes in our operations, or payments to clients or reporting to U.S. authorities;

In addition, we may infringe on claims of third-party patents, and we may face intellectual property challenges from other parties, including clients or service providers with whom we may engage in the development or implementation of other products, services or solutions.
The risk of such infringement is enhanced in the current competitive “Fintech” environment, particularly with respect to our development of new products and services containing significant technology elements and dependencies, any of which could become the subject of an infringement claim.
We may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes.
Third-party intellectual rights, valid or not, may also impede our deployment of the full scope of our products and service capabilities in all jurisdictions in which we operate or market our products and services.
State Street Corporation | 40 Table of Contents Acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures pose risks for our business.
As part of our business strategy, we acquire complementary businesses and technologies, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and divest portions of our business.
We undertake transactions of varying sizes to, among other reasons, expand our geographic footprint, access new clients, technologies or services, develop closer or more collaborative relationships with our business partners, bolster existing servicing capabilities, efficiently deploy capital or leverage cost savings or other business or financial opportunities.
We may not achieve the expected benefits of these transactions, which could result in increased costs, lowered revenues, ineffective deployment of capital, regulatory concerns, exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation.
Transactions of this nature also involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, strategic, managerial, operational, cultural and employment challenges, which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
For example, the businesses that we acquire or our strategic alliances or joint ventures may under-perform relative to the price paid or the resources committed by us; we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth or cost savings; or we may otherwise be adversely affected by acquisition-related charges.
The intellectual property of an acquired business may be an important component of the value that we agree to pay for such a business.
However, such acquisitions are subject to the risks that the acquired business may not own the intellectual property that we believe we are acquiring, that the intellectual property is dependent on licenses from third parties, that the acquired business infringes on the intellectual property rights of others, that the technology does not have the acceptance in the marketplace that we anticipated or that the technology requires significant investment to remain competitive.
Further , past acquisitions have resulted in the recognition of goodwill and other significant intangible assets in our consolidated statement of condition.
For example, we recorded goodwill and intangible assets of $453 million associated with our acquisition of GE Asset Management in 2016.
These assets are not eligible for inclusion in regulatory capital under applicable requirements.
In addition, we may be required to record impairment in our consolidated statement of income in future periods if we determine that the value of these assets has declined.
Through our acquisitions or joint ventures, we may also assume unknown or undisclosed business, operational, tax, regulatory and other liabilities, fail to properly assess known contingent liabilities or assume businesses with internal control deficiencies.
While in most of our transactions we seek to mitigate these risks through, among other things, due diligence and indemnification provisions, these or other risk-mitigating provisions we put in place may not be sufficient to address these liabilities and contingencies.
Other major financial services firms have recently paid significant penalties to resolve government investigations into matters conducted in significant part by acquired entities.
Various regulatory approvals or consents, formal or informal, are generally required prior to closing of these transactions, which may include approvals or non-objections from the Federal Reserve and other domestic and non-U.S. regulatory authorities.
These regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the completion of the acquisition or require changes to its terms that materially affect the terms of the transaction or our ability to capture some of the opportunities presented by the transaction, or may not approve the transaction.
Any such conditions, or any associated regulatory delays, could limit the benefits of the transaction.
Acquisitions or joint ventures we announce may not be completed if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals, if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied.
The integration of our acquisitions results in risks to our business and other uncertainties.
The integration of acquisitions presents risks that differ from the risks associated with our ongoing operations.
Integration activities are complicated and time consuming and can involve significant unforeseen costs.
We may not be able to effectively assimilate services, technologies, key personnel or businesses of acquired companies into our business or service offerings as anticipated, alliances may not be successful, and we may not achieve related revenue growth or cost savings.
We also face the risk of being unable to retain, or cross-sell our products or services to, the clients of acquired companies or joint ventures and the risk of being unable to cross-sell acquired products or services to our existing clients.
Acquisitions of investment servicing businesses entail information technology systems conversions, which involve operational risks."

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS Ownership interests that are held by owners other than Sempra Energy and SDG&E in subsidiaries or entities consolidated by them are accounted for and reported as noncontrolling interests.
As a result, noncontrolling interests are reported as a separate component of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Earnings/losses attributable to the noncontrolling interests are separately identified on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and net income/loss and comprehensive income/loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests are separately identified on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity.
Sale of Noncontrolling Interests In the first quarter of 2013, Sempra Energy’s subsidiary, IEnova, completed a private offering in the U.S. and outside of Mexico and a concurrent public offering in Mexico of common stock.
The aggregate shares of common stock sold in the offerings represent approximately 18.9 percent of IEnova’s outstanding ownership interest.
IEnova is reported within the Sempra Mexico reportable segment.
The proceeds from the offerings, net of offering costs, were approximately $574 million in U.S. dollar equivalent.
IEnova has used the net proceeds of the offerings primarily for general corporate purposes, and for the funding of its investments and ongoing expansion plans.
Consistent with applicable accounting guidance, changes in noncontrolling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
When there are changes in noncontrolling interests of a subsidiary that do not result in a change of control, any difference between carrying value and fair value related to the change in ownership is recorded as an adjustment to shareholders’ equity."

We accrue minimum rents on a straight-line basis over the terms of their respective leases.
Substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year.
We recognize overage rents only when each tenant's sales exceed the applicable sales threshold.
We amortize any tenant inducements as a reduction of revenue utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the tenant, if shorter. </font> </p> <p style=""margin:5pt 0pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size: 10pt""> <font style=""display: inline;font-family:Times;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We structure our leases to allow us to recover a significant portion of our property operating, real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, and advertising and promotion expenses from our tenants.
A substantial portion of our leases, other than those for anchor stores, require the tenant to reimburse us for a substantial portion of our operating expenses, including common area maintenance, or CAM, real estate taxes and insurance.
This significantly reduces our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
Such property operating expenses typically include utility, insurance, security, janitorial, landscaping, food court and other administrative expenses.
As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 for substantially all of our leases in the U.S. mall portfolio, we receive a fixed payment from the tenant for the CAM component which is recognized as revenue when earned.
When not reimbursed by the fixed-CAM component, CAM expense reimbursements are based on the tenant's proportionate share of the allocable operating expenses and CAM capital expenditures for the property.
We also receive escrow payments for these reimbursements from substantially all our non-fixed CAM tenants and monthly fixed CAM payments throughout the year.
We accrue reimbursements from tenants for recoverable portions of all these expenses as revenue in the period the applicable expenditures are incurred.
We recognize differences between estimated recoveries and the final billed amounts in the subsequent year.
These differences were not material in any period presented.
Our advertising and promotional costs are expensed as incurred.
